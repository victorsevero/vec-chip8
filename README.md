# CHIP-8 Implementation in Python

This project is an attempt to make CHIP-8 interpreters with Python according to the following plan:

- [X] standard implementation
- [X] `numpy` implementation
- [ ] vectorized `numpy` implementation
- [ ] vectorized `torch` implementation

The objective is to check if implementing vectorized interpreters on CPU and/or GPU is a viable approach and if it offers a performance boost for Reinforcement Learning applications.
